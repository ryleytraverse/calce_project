# Soc/Soh Estimation Framework Research Replication
## Code written by Ryley Traverse

This project looks at estimating state of chage and state of health of lithium-ion batteries using a joint framework described in 
[this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S036054422303195X, 'A novel inegrated SOC-SOH estimation framework for whole-life-cycle lithium-ion batteries').

It uses an open source dataset available from the Center of Advanced Life Cycle Engineering at the University of Maryland

There are two notebooks that walk through the data preparation and modeling with a discussion of results at the end.

This project provides an excelent example of work similar to what was done at my first job out of college.
